## Required software

The following software is required for the theme development and deployment workflow.

- [Local](https://localwp.com/)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [Microsoft VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Version control:

[GitHub](https://github.com) has been used for the main production-ready site. The cited code of this branch is ready to
be deployed.

## Deployment and hosting

As a team, we decided to host our website through [HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com/) as they provide more than 6
million domains, 99.9% uptime and it's cheap compared to its competitors.

Staging environment was kept for testing any changes that were made in the local environment. Testing these changes on a
live site allowed us to perform these tests without running the risk of adversely affecting the real website which is
running on a separate production environment.
