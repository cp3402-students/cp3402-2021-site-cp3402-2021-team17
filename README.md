## Domain and hosting

As a team, we decided to host our website through [HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com/) as they provide more than 6
million domains, 99.9% uptime and it's cheap compared to its competitors.

## How to import this site into local environment:

Download [LOCAL](https://localwp.com/) and install on your computer. Once the installation is complete, open local and
create a new site, select **custom** and continue by providing your WordPress credentials. <br/>
Congratulations! Your WordPress site is now local. Please check by clicking **open site** button.
